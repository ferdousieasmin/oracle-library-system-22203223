-- 2.1 DATA RETRIEVAL QUERIES
-- ===========================

-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve books that have been partially borrowed
SELECT book_id, title, total_copies, available_copies

-- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Move completed and old transactions to an archive

-- Step A: Create archive table structure if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS TRANSACTION_ARCHIVE AS

-- Step B: Copy old returned records to archive
INSERT INTO TRANSACTION_ARCHIVE
SELECT * FROM TRANSACTIONS
